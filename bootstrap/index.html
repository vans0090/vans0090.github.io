        <h1 class="display-3">Bootstrap</h1>
        <p class="lead">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.</p>

          <h3>Easy to Use</h3>
          <p>Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap.Web designers and web developers like Bootstrap because it is flexible and easy to work with. Its main advantages are that it is responsive by design, it maintains wide browser compatibility, it offers consistent design by using re-usable components, and it is very easy to use and quick to learn. This structure can be easily incorporated in your own projectâ€™s file structure by just including the Bootstrap files exactly as they come out of the zip archive, or if it suits your project better, you can rearrange these files and place them anywhere you like.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-5 bg-secondary text-white">
          <h3>Responsive Features</h3>
          <p>Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops. Another prominent feature of Bootstrap is its responsive utility classes. Using responsive utility classes, a particular piece of content can be made to appear or hide only on devices depending on the size of the screen being used. This feature is extremely helpful for designers who want to make a mobile and tablet-friendly version of their websites. Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.</p>

          <p class="lead">A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript files that can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables developers to implement further customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular, meaning that the developer can remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the uncompiled Sass files.</p>

              <h3>Great Grid system</h3>

              <h3>Good Documentation</h3>
              <p>Not only does Bootstrap offer styling for almost every element a typical website or web application requires, it also provides a great documentation with examples and demo that only make it more easier for even someone new. Designers need a solid foundation that gives us almost everything a typical website would require but is flexible enough for customization. Thanks to hundreds of hours spent by some developers and companies, we now have dozens of CSS Frameworks to choose from.</p>

              <p>Among all the available CSS frameworks out there, Bootstrap is my favorite and also one of the most widely used. It's included by default in Joomla 3, and is wildly popular amongst WordPress and Drupal users. In the last 3 years, Bootstrap's popularity grew over 1,000% and has become by far the most popular CSS framework.</p>
