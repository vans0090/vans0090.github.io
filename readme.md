# Welcome to my portfolio
## I am vanshika
##### I am a designer and web developer willing to learn new observation skills.
This website was by far the most interesting and **challenging** to make through my entire course.
There were many challenges that I had:
* Using bootstrap _kindof professionally_ for the first time.
* Keeping it in a good layout as it was representing me.
* Working with github.
* Folder names and linking mulitple assets with each other, located in diferent folders either.
* Adding my resume that opens in a different tab.

To overcome these, number of things helped me:
1. My professor, (_obviously_)
2. Internet.
3. Youtube.

Some of the things that are solutions to my _above mentioned_ problems are:
* Pushing everytime you make 3-4 changes to avoid long time waiting and even _"timed out session"_ in future.
* using _**/-(forward slash)**_ to link files outside the folder.
* Using **target="_blank"** to open any file in a new tab.

Some of the below mentioned are the resources that I used for this assignment:
1. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
2. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
3. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
4. [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
